# A_ShopDB
A small project made with friends in order to learn the SQL language, the secrets of database design and their implementation.

Our main goal was to create a system that would facilitate the management of store resources and be relatively easy to implement extensive functions. 

We also pushed the base into third normal form.
Possible expansion paths:
- rating system
-system of notifications and complaints (currently we only control the status of the service, we could also add comments from customers)
- structure optimization
